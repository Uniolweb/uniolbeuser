# uniolbeuser

Adds TYPO3 Backend module to show BE users and BE groups depending on where the
user is in the pagetree.

Upcoming is also the functionality to show the file mounts in the filelist.

## Important

Currently the output will be in German because no localization is provided yet!

## Privacy concerns

*   Be aware that BE users who have access to this module will see the names
    of other users who have access to the same pages (and files) of this user.

## Setup

*   Make the BE module available for the users who should see it.
